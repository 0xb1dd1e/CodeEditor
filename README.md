# CodeEditor

An embedded text editor for [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

## Installing

CodeEditor is developed using the new [kaizen dependency management framework](http://github.com/Unity-Technologies/kaizen) for Unity extensions:
* import [kaizen.unityPackage](https://github.com/downloads/Unity-Technologies/kaizen/kaizen.unityPackage) into your project
* open a command line shell (proper Unity GUI to come soon, maybe you want to help?) into the newly created _Assets/kaizen_ directory
* ./gradlew update

## Hacking

    git clone it
    cd CodeEditor
    ./gradlew update
    ./gradlew test
